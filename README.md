## Notes
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Please explain the cool features of your program. Anything that you feel like you did a good job at or were creative about, explain it in bullets here. Additionally, any design decisions should be made here.

1. **Dual Game System**: Integrated both Dots and Boxes and Sliding Puzzle games into a unified GameManager interface, allowing users to choose between games
2. **Flexible Board Sizing**: Board dimensions can be customized from 1x1 up to 50x50, with proper validation and error handling
3. **Smart Edge Management**: Uses separate arrays for horizontal and vertical edges instead of a traditional 2D piece array, making box completion detection efficient
4. **Real-time Box Detection**: Automatically detects when boxes are completed and awards points to the player who closed the box
5. **Turn Management**: Players only switch turns when they don't score a point, following traditional dots and boxes rules
6. **Comprehensive Input Validation**: Validates all user inputs including names, board dimensions, row/column coordinates, and directions
7. **Visual Board Display**: Clean ASCII art display showing dots, edges, and completed boxes with player initials
8. **Game State Tracking**: Tracks game completion, final scores, and determines winners with tie detection
9. **Replay Functionality**: Players can play multiple rounds with different board sizes
10. **Extensible Design**: Abstract Game and Board classes make it easy to add new game types in the future
